# Problem 1

\_ Import Instacart Data

``` r
instacart_data = 
  library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart") 
```

\_ Clean & Import Data

  - Change Product Name to a factor variable
  - Renaming variables

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename("order_cart" = add_to_cart_order, "day" = order_dow, "hour" = order_hour_of_day, "name" = product_name) %>% 
  mutate(name = as.factor(name))
```

\_ Explore Data

  - The instacart dataset comes from an online grocery service with over
    3 million online grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart
    users. This dataset allows us to observe trends in online grocery
    purchasing. The main variables are name (indicating the type of
    product), aisle (indicating which aisle the product came from) and
    the hour and day of the week that these items were ordered. Here are
    a variety of ways we can explore the data. With summmarize, we can
    observe the different types of products and how many people order.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarize(n= n())
```

\_ Exploratory plot

  - I started doing exploratory plots and saw quite quickly that the
    distribution of products ordered is extremely right skewed. There
    are by far fewer products that people order time and time again (\>
    5000) then items that are bought infrequently I wanted to identify
    which products are ordered by far the most. These are Bananas,
    Strawberries, Spinach, and other fruits and vegetables.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(name) %>% 
  filter(n > 5000) %>% 
  mutate(name = fct_reorder(name, n, .desc = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot (aes(x = name, y = n)) + coord_flip() + 
      geom_bar(stat = "identity") + labs(title = "Plot of Items Ordered for each Aisle", x = "Aisle ", y = "number of orders")
```

\_ Understanding average day and average hour of purchases

  - Here we are looking at the product name and the average day and hour
    people are ordering products. For example, of 461 orders of 1%
    Lowfat Milk, the average day to buy was 2.7 and 13th hour. So people
    are buying milk at the middle of their days\! That is approximately
    the same day and hour that pepole are buying 100 calorie per bag
    popcorn, interesting\!

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
   group_by(name) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(),
            mean_hour = mean(hour, na.rm = TRUE), 
            mean_day = mean(day, na.rm = TRUE)
            ) %>%

\_ Counting Aisles

  - Here we can see that there are 134 aisles.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
count(aisle_id, aisle)
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 3
    ##    aisle_id aisle                          n
    ##       <int> <chr>                      <int>

    ## 10       10 kitchen supplies             448
    ## # … with 124 more rows

\_ Which aisles are the most items ordered from?

  - Here we can see the top 5 aisles that items are ordered from. The
    aisles with the top purchases are “water seltzer sparkling water”
    and “yogurt”. In fact, there are more purchases from the yogurt
    aisle then the last three combined\! What does this mean for lactose
    intolerance.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>%
  filter(min_rank(desc(aisle)) < 6 )
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 x 2
    ##   aisle                             n
    ##   <chr>                         <int>
    ## 1 trash bags liners              1621
    ## 2 vitamins supplements           1969
    ## 3 water seltzer sparkling water 36617
    ## 4 white wines                    1088
    ## 5 yogurt                        55240

\_ Plot showing the number of items ordered in each aisle

``` r
library(ggridges)
library(patchwork)
library(viridis)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

  ggplot2.continuous.color = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis")

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d

theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
```

``` r

instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter( n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n, .desc = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot (aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + coord_flip() + 
      geom_bar(stat = "identity") + labs(title = "Plot of Items Ordered for each Aisle", x = "Aisle ", y = "number of orders")
```

\_ Table showing 3 most popular items in each of the aisles

This table allows us to see the most popular items from three aisles. In
the baking aisle the top products are 1) light brown sugar 2) baking
soda and 3) cane sugar. In the vegetables/fruits aisle the top
ingredients are 1) baby spinach 2) rasberries and 3) blueberries. In dog
food care, the top products are 1) Snack Sticks 2) Organix Chicken, and
3) Small dog biscuits.

``` r
instacart %>% 
      filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
           group_by(aisle, name) %>% 
           summarize(n = n()) %>% 
           top_n(3) %>% 
           arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
          knitr::kable()
```

    ## Selecting by n

\_ Table showing mean hour of the day when Pink Lady Apples and Coffee
Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week

  - We can see that the mean hour of the day most orders occur is
    between 12-15 indicating that people are online shopping at work\!\!

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
    mutate(day = recode(day,

\_ Problem 2 Cleaning

Clean BRFSS Data

  - I have cleaned the data here, renamed variables and organized just
    by “Overall Health.” I changed my variable to be a factor vector,
    but my code won’t run so I have attached it here. I have tried to
    sort and order but both won’t work.

  - sort.list(response, partial = NULL, na.last = TRUE, decreasing =
    FALSE, method = c(“Poor”, “Fair”, “Good”, “Very Good”, “Excellent”))

  - order(oops\_brfss\_smart2010, response, na.last = TRUE, decreasing =
    FALSE, method = c(“Poor”, “Fair”, “Good”, “Very Good”, “Excellent”))

<!-- end list -->

``` r
  library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010") 

  brfss_smart2010 = 
  brfss_smart2010 %>%  
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
      rename(state = locationabbr, county = locationdesc) %>% 
        select(year:data_value) %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
    filter(response == c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Excellent")) %>%
            mutate(response = as.factor(response))
```

\_ In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What
about in 2010?

  - In Year 2002, CT, FL, MA, NC, NJ, and PA were observed at 7 or more
    locations.

<!-- end list -->

``` r

  - In Year 2010, CA, CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, and OH were
    observed at 7 or more locations.

\_ Constructing a Dataset with year, state, only excellent responses,
and an average of data\_value

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")

 brfss_smart2010_clean = 
    brfss_smart2010 %>%  
    separate("Locationdesc", into = c("State","County")) %>% 
    select("Year", "State", "Response", "Data_value") %>% 
    filter(Response == "Excellent") %>% 
    group_by(Year, State) %>% 
    summarize(mean_value = mean(Data_value, na.rm = TRUE))
```

\_ Spaghetti Plot

  - I know this plot is quite ugly, but I think it is what you are
    looking. This plot is limited to Excellent responses, and contains,
    year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value across
    locations within a state.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
  library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")


  brfss_smart2010 %>%  
    separate("Locationdesc", into = c("location","desc")) %>% 
  select("Year", "location", "Response", "Data_value") %>% 
  rename("State" = location) %>% 
    filter(Response == "Excellent") %>% 
   group_by(Year, State) %>% 
  summarize(mean_value = mean(Data_value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
ggplot(aes (x = Year, y = mean_value, color = State)) + geom_point() + geom_line()
