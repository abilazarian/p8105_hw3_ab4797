\_ Import Instacart Data

``` r
instacart_data = 
  library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart") 
```

\_ Clean & Import Data

  - Change Product Name to a factor variable
  - Renaming variables

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename("order_cart" = add_to_cart_order, "day" = order_dow, "hour" = order_hour_of_day, "name" = product_name) %>% 
  mutate(name = as.factor(name))
```

\_ Explore Data

  - The instacart dataset comes from an online grocery service with over
    3 million online grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart
    users. This dataset allows us to observe trends in online grocery
    purchasing. The main variables are name (indicating the type of
    product), aisle (indicating which aisle the product came from) and
    the hour and day of the week that these items were ordered. Here are
    a variety of ways we can explore the data. With summmarize, we can
    observe the different types of products and how many people order.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarize(n= n())
```

    ## # A tibble: 39,123 x 2
    ##    name                                                                   n
    ##    <fct>                                                              <int>
    ##  1 "\\\"Constant Comment\\\" Black Tea"                                   3
    ##  2 "\\\"Constant Comment\\\" Decaffeinated Black Tea Blend"               3
    ##  3 "\\\"Darn Good\\\" Chili Mix"                                          5
    ##  4 "\\\"Im Pei-nut Butter\\\" Double Chocolate Cookie & Peanut Butte…     5
    ##  5 "\\\"Mies Vanilla Rohe\\\" Ice Cream Bars"                             6
    ##  6 "\\\"Mokaccino\\\" Milk + Blue Bottle Coffee Chocolate"               10
    ##  7 & Go! Hazelnut Spread + Pretzel Sticks                                10
    ##  8 #2 Coffee Filters                                                     22
    ##  9 #2 Cone White Coffee Filters                                           1
    ## 10 #2 Mechanical Pencils                                                  1
    ## # … with 39,113 more rows

\_ Exploratory plot

  - I started doing exploratory plots and saw quite quickly that the
    distribution of products ordered is extremely right skewed. There
    are by far fewer products that people order time and time again (\>
    5000) then items that are bought infrequently I wanted to identify
    which products are ordered by far the most. These are Bananas,
    Strawberries, Spinach, and other fruits and vegetables.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(name) %>% 
  filter(n > 5000) %>% 
  mutate(name = fct_reorder(name, n, .desc = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot (aes(x = name, y = n)) + coord_flip() + 
      geom_bar(stat = "identity") + labs(title = "Plot of Items Ordered for each Aisle", x = "Aisle ", y = "number of orders")
```
